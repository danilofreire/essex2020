# Motivation

* Mosquitoes are the world's deadliest animal

--

* Nearly 700 million people contract mosquito-borne illnesses each year, causing more than one million deaths ([World Mosquito Programme 2020](https://www.worldmosquitoprogram.org/en/learn/mosquito-borne-diseases))

--

* Major vector: the *Aedes aegypti* mosquito

  - Spreads dengue fever, yellow fever, zika virus, chikungunya, and other diseases

--

* Forty percent of the world's population, about 3 billion people, live in areas with a risk of dengue ([CDC 2020](https://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/stories/world-deadliest-animal.html))

--

* Last year, there were two major dengue outbreaks:

  - South-east Asia: 1 million cases ([WHO 2020](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dengue-and-severe-dengue))

  - Latin America: 3 million cases reported ([PAHO 2020](https://www.paho.org/data/index.php/en/mnu-topics/indicadores-dengue-en/dengue-nacional-en/252-dengue-pais-ano-en.html))

---

# Motivation

* One vaccine for dengue has been tested in about 20 countries

  - Side effect: increases the risk of severe dengue in individuals who didn't have dengue prior to the vaccination

--

* Research shows that preventive health care policies are the most effective method to fight the *Aedes aegypti* mosquito ([Eisen et al. 2009](https://academic.oup.com/jme/article/46/6/1245/921096)).

--

* In particular, mosquito control requires teams of preventive healthcare workers to visit households to exterminate breeding sites

--

* However, while there is a substantial literature on how to create incentives for private workers (see [Lazear 2018](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.32.3.195)), we know little about how to motivate civil servants ([Banerjee et al. 2008](https://academic.oup.com/jeea/article-abstract/6/2-3/487/2295851))

  - Constrains: job stability, limited oversight, corruption

---

# What we do

* We run a field experiment to measure the impact of different bonus schemes on the productivity of health care workers

* More specifically, we hired and trained subjects that had to visit houses and help residents to exterminate mosquito breeding sites in the city of Rio Verde, Brazil

* We chose Rio Verde as the *Aedes* mosquito is endemic to the city and in 2017 (one year prior to our experiment) Rio Verde had a high number of dengue infections

* We assigned performance monetary rewards in the form of individual and peer performance bonuses

* We measured if the experiment had an impact on the number of houses visited, time spent on each household, the number of breeding sites removed, the number of larvae exterminated, and dengue incidence

---

# What we find 

* We find that bonuses increased the number of cleaned breeding sites in both treatment status (individual and team bonuses) and team bonuses also improved larvae extermination 

* Control group presented a high incidence of houses visited in less than two minutes apart from each other, which suggests that the workers may cheat in the absence of financial incentives

* Taken together, the intervention decreased the disease incidence in 10.3%, but the results are not robust 

* Overall, we show that performance bonuses do increase productivity in public service provision

* Small financial incentives to health care workers can significantly reduce public health care costs on clinics and hospitals

---

# Rio Verde

* Rio Verde is a municipality in the Brazilian state of Goiás, about 420km from Brasília

* It is the fourth larger city in Goiás and the largest producer of grains in the state

* Out of the potential cities that could host the experiment (5), Rio Verde experienced the most substantial disease occurrence

* We worked in partnership with the Rio Verde City Hall and the Mayor's Office

---

# Recruitment

* Our goal was to select and train a group of participants to visit households in all neighbourhoods in Rio Verde

* We used Facebook advertisements to publicise our job offer

* The Facebook advertisement directed potential participants to a Google Form in which participants were told about the job and asked to leave an email address if interested 

* Using the e-mail address, we a Qualtrics survey with pre-treatment demographic questions

* To be eligible for the experiment, subjects should be over 18 years of age and had completed their participation in the field experiment

# Randomisation and masking

* We assigned participants to three types of monetary incentives:
  - Flat compensation regardless of performance (control group)
  - Individual performance bonus (individual treatment)
  - Peer performance bonus (collective treatment)

* Block randomisation applied on seven variables computed from pre-intervention surveys

*  To avoid spillover, we directed them to three separate headquarters (HQs), one for each treatment, geographically distanced from one another

* Participants knew about other groups, but unaware of the different payment schemes

---

# Training

* Participants received their monitoring cellphones and working kits on the 5th May, 2018

* Instructed on how to perform measurements and use the equipment

* Informed about the *Aedes aegypti* ecology

* Participants were paired randomly (a government requirement)

* Research assistants reinforced the treatment for each of the pairs in one-on-one discussions

# Treatment

* We informed all groups that we would monitor their performance in the field

* **Control group**: compensation without a performance assessment

* **Individual group**: double the compensation for anyone whose performance was above the median (baseline: 20 USD)

* **Collective treatment group**: double the compensation for each team whose performance was above the median (baseline: 40 dollars per pair) 

* We had about 65 people per group

---

# Balance tests

.center[**Table 1**: Covariate balance]

.center[![:scale 75%](balance.png)]

---

# Tasks

* Each pair had to visit about 120 households in 3 blocks

* Tasks:

  - Ring the doorbell and explain that the municipality has a dengue fever outbreak

  - Instruct dwellers on how to lower the disease incidence

  - If granted permission, enter the home and search for clean breeding sites

  - Report their performance by taking a photo on their cellphones

  - If they discover larvae, record a video showing the larvae before exterminating it

  - Take a picture of the house before leaving it

# Outcome 1: Field productivity

.center[**Table 2**: Field productivity]

.center[![:scale 75%](productivity.png)]

---

# Outcome 1: Field productivity

* Workers who received monetary incentives visit *fewer* houses than those in the control group

--

* The result seems counterintuitive, but it is not:

--

* The treatment rewards the participants for exterminating larvae and cleaning breeding sites, not for visiting households

--

* In the control group, participants had no incentives to do a thorough job, but they were still instructed to cover the whole assigned territory to receive compensation

---

# Outcome 1: Field productivity

* On average, workers who received the individual incentive found 25.1 more breeding sites than the control group

--

* The effect was slightly smaller for those in the collective bonus group: 21.5 more breeding sites

--

* Workers who received the collective bonus also had 16.3% higher probability of finding larvae than those in the control group

--

* In a nutshell: **financial incentives work**

---

# Outcome 2: Disease incidence

* We run a series of differences-in-differences models to:

--

* Assess whether the intervention *per se* had any effect

  - We combine both treatment groups

  - We look into the disease outcomes (reported infections) in several time windows

--

* Compare disease incidence in each of the treatment statuses with disease incidence in the control group

---

# Outcome 2: Disease incidence

.center[**Table 3**: Disease incidence over time (differences-in-differences)]

.center[![:scale 90%](incidence.png)]

---

# Outcome 2: Disease incidence

* We find that:

--

* Combined, our treatments reduce *Aedes*-borne diseases in 10.3%, but the effect is significant only at the 10% level

--

* Treatment effects in other windows are not statistically significant but the sign is consistent with lower disease incidence

--

* Comparing individual and collective incentives, collective bonuses decrease disease incidence by 2.9%, but the result is again not significant

---

# Why doesn't higher productivity lead to better outcomes?

* Our best guess is that **our treatment isn't strong enough**

--

* Finding a breeding site and exterminating larvae in a particular household does not imply that the area is safe from the *Aedes* mosquito

  - Finding a larvae container indicates that there is a mosquito in a 70 meters radius

  - Our treatment probably didn't cover enough areas to ensure there was no mosquitos around the assigned blocks

--

* Rio Verde had a significant rates of dengue incidence, reaching 3,411 reported infections from January to September 2018

  - Maybe the treatment only works when applied for longer periods of time or in more neighbourhoods

---

# Discussion

* We show that monetary incentives increase the productivity of community health care workers in Brazil

* We contrast a control group (which received a flat performance fee) with two treatment groups:

  - One received an individual performance bonus
  - Another received a collective performance bonus

* Both treatments increase the number of breeding sites the workers find

* Collective incentives outperforms individual performance rewards when the task is more laborious and excludable (exterminating larvae)

---

# Discussion

* Important policy implications:

* First, financial incentives do work for individuals doing public service

* Second, collective bonuses work better than individual incentives 

* Lastly, and importantly, higher field productivity *does not* guarantee that the *Aedes aegypti* can be eradicated

* The treatment needs to cover a wide area and persist for a substantial amount of time to have a lasting effect
