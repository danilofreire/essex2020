## Danilo Freire and Umberto Mignozzetti

This repository contains the slides for our webinar on the 25th of August, 2020 at the University of Essex. We present the preliminary results for "Incentives in Health Care Prevention: Evidence from an Experimental *Aedes Aegypti* Control Programme in Brazil". The paper will soon be available online. 

We use [xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) with the [metropolis theme](https://github.com/pat-s/xaringan-metropolis) to create our slides. You may find them [here](http://danilofreire.github.io/gsan-essex-2020/aedes-rct.html).
